## Recent Fixes (v1.0.2)

### ‚úÖ Stream URL Issue Resolution
- **Problem**: Extension was unable to get stream URLs, all endpoints returned 404 errors
- **Solution**: Discovered the correct API endpoint parameter format
- **Working Endpoint**: `GET /api/stream?trackId={id}` (note: `trackId` in camelCase)
- **Stream Source**: URLs are served from Qobuz's CDN via Akamaized

### API Investigation Results
Through extensive testing, we determined:
- The API requires exact parameter name: `trackId` (not `track_id`, `id`, or other variants)
- Only GET requests are supported for streaming (POST returns 405 Method Not Allowed)
- The API returns JSON with a `url` field containing the actual stream URL
- Stream URLs point to `streaming-qobuz-std.akamaized.net` with authentication tokens

## Debugging Stream Issues

If you encounter stream URL issues:

1. Check that the track ID is correct (numeric)
2. Verify the API parameter is `trackId` (camelCase)
3. Ensure the request uses GET method
4. Check the JSON response contains a `url` field
5. Validate the returned URL is from a known CDN

Example working request:
```bash
curl "https://dab.yeet.su/api/stream?trackId=58452887"
```
